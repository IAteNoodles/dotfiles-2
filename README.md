# dotfiles
These are my theme's dotfiles.

It is recomended you know what you're doing before installing them as I just uploaded them quickly for a fellow Arch user.
The long and short of it is, put the files in your .config folder.

You'll proably want to edit the i3 autostart section in i3/config. It's labelled # Auto start applications

I use blueman for bluetooth management

feh for wallpaper

flameshot for screenshots

dunst for notifications

thunar as my gui file manager

picom for compositing

and pia is in there for my vpn but you'll surely want to delete that.

Anyways, you get the idea.
Use with caution, know what you're doing. Check the configs and edit to get your desired effect.

I use dracula theme pretty much everywhere so my color schemes are based on that.

ok good luck.
